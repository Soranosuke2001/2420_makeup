You have successfully created the Arch Linux VM!

## Starting up ArchLinux from VirtualBox

1. Click on the ArchLinux VM that you have created in the previous step and click the "Start" button.

- Note: This will open up a new terminal where we will be interacting with ArchLinux itself.

- **Note:** It will take a little bit of time for ArchLinux to startup. Once it does, the screen should look as the image below.
